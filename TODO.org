* DONE

** DONE Also, moving from one file diff to the next does not push far enough up so that the previous one is not completely removed from screen. You want to get it to the point right before it starts to stick.
** DONE The contents of an untracked added file are not visible.
** DONE Something isn't working if you turn on and turn off on track to change your size. It's the same for on stage as well. Also, I'm not sure how that interacts with the auto update, auto reload. It still seems funky.
** DONE Changing the branch and anything else like that shouldn't reload the entire page.
** DONE removed files show as added
** DONE hover background on prev/next file header buttons is wrong colour


** DONE I want a review app for lsocal use, with reload, and see if that takes a branch. So it does not have to get branchy, I mean. Finds a free port within a given range. It starts to surf. Possibly demonizing. And it shoots.

** DONE is the poor performance when collapse/expandall necessary?


* TODO

** TODO There's a problem again with expanding the diffs that is sometimes broken like it used to be. Well, regardless, there are definitely some instances where expanding the hunks doesn't work correctly.

** TODO If you expand hump diffs until they merge, there's still a bright line between them. I thought we'd already fixed that, but I guess not.

** TODO The whole hunkparching thing needs to be fixed. I don't know if we can burn tokens on that.

** TODO Also, I'd love to know where the red box outlines are coming from on the syntax highlighting.

** TODO There should probably be a font chooser in the web app somehow. I don't want it super visible. I don't know if we need to maybe replace the theme with a settings, and then the settings doesn't fly out with a theme and a font and a...

** TODO Better command line handling options as well as better standard output when running deflishes.

** TODO ui layout improvements
