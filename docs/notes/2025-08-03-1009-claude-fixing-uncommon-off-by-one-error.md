> good morning. i don't want you to change anything yet, but i'm having a problem i'd like your help in solving: for some reason, the
  "line_count" attribute of a hunk (that is: the one counting lines in the hunk, NOT the full file line count) is off-by-one. it claims
   a count of 8, but the diff hunk only has 7, and this is causing knock-on effects (although it works right everywhere else i'm
  looking, there's at least this one exact case that always fails.) can you see anything to fix here?

⏺ I'll help you investigate the line count issue in your diff hunk processing. Let me examine the relevant code to understand how line
  counts are calculated.

⏺ Search(pattern: "line_count")
  ⎿  Found 11 files (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(src/difflicious/diff_parser.py)
  ⎿  Read 489 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I can see the issue! Looking at the code, there are two different line_count attributes being used:

  1. File-level line_count (line 128): This is the total number of lines in the entire file, calculated by _get_file_line_count()
  2. Hunk-level line counts (lines 151-153): These are old_count and new_count from the unidiff library, representing the number of
  lines in the hunk

  The problem appears to be in the _group_lines_into_hunks function where it's copying the original hunk metadata. Let me check how the
   frontend uses these values:

⏺ Search(pattern: "line_count", glob: "*.html", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(src/difflicious/templates/diff_hunk.html)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me see where hunk.line_count is set in the template service:

⏺ Read(src/difflicious/services/template_service.py)
  ⎿  Read 268 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Found it! The issue is on line 174 in template_service.py:174. The hunk's line_count is being set to hunk.get("new_count", 0), which
  comes from the unidiff library's target length count.

  However, looking at the git diff format specification, new_count in a hunk header like @@ -10,5 +10,8 @@ represents the number of
  lines in the target side of the diff including context lines. But when you count the actual lines in the hunk body, you're only
  counting the visible diff lines (additions, deletions, and context), which may differ by 1 due to how git handles the final newline.

  The off-by-one error you're seeing (claiming 8 but only having 7) suggests that the unidiff library's new_count includes something
  that's not being rendered as a visible line - likely the final newline or a boundary condition.

  To fix this, the line_count should be calculated from the actual number of lines in the hunk rather than relying on new_count. Here's
   the fix:

  "line_count": len(hunk.get("lines", [])),  # Count actual rendered lines

  Instead of:

  "line_count": hunk.get("new_count", 0),  # This can be off-by-one

  The actual number of lines being rendered in the template should be used rather than the git diff header's target count.

> That is outstanding, thank you!

⏺ Perfect! You've implemented the fix exactly right. Using len(hunk.get("lines", [])) to count the actual rendered lines instead of
  relying on the git diff header's new_count will eliminate that off-by-one error.

  I also notice you've updated the line_end calculation on line 152 to use the actual line count (_lines) as well, which makes the
  logic consistent throughout. This ensures that both the line_count and line_end values are based on the same source of truth - the
  actual number of lines being rendered.

  This should fix the knock-on effects you mentioned since the template will now receive accurate line counts that match what's
  actually being displayed.
