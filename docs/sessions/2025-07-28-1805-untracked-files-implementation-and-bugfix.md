# Session 2025-07-28-1805: Untracked Files Implementation and Critical UI Bugfix

## Overview
This session focused on implementing untracked file support in Difflicious and resolving a critical frontend filtering bug that prevented untracked files from displaying in the UI.

## Problem Statement
User reported that untracked files were not appearing in the UI despite:
- Untracked checkbox being checked in the interface
- Untracked section appearing when files exist
- But no file names or content showing within the untracked section

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Investigation
1. **API Layer**: Confirmed API correctly returned untracked files with proper data structure
2. **Backend Processing**: Verified git operations and data processing worked correctly
3. **Frontend Data Flow**: Discovered data was making it through JavaScript processing
4. **Template Rendering**: Identified the issue was in the UI rendering layer

### Debug Process
Using browser console debugging, traced the data flow:
- ✅ API Response: `untracked: count=2, files=2`
- ✅ JavaScript Processing: `Updated untracked: count=2, files=2`  
- ✅ Computed Properties: `visibleGroups` correctly computed
- ❌ Template Rendering: `files: Array []` (empty despite correct count)

### Critical Bug Discovery
The root cause was in the `filterFiles()` function in `app.js`. The "Show only changed files" filter was incorrectly removing untracked files because:

```javascript
// Problematic condition:
file.additions > 0 || file.deletions > 0
```

**Issue**: Untracked files have `additions: 0` and `deletions: 0` since they're new files with no modifications, causing them to be filtered out despite being legitimate "changes" to show.

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Data Structure Standardization
- **Problem**: Inconsistent property naming between frontend (`file.path`) and backend (`file.file`)
- **Solution**: Standardized on `path` property across entire codebase
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `git_operations.py`: Updated to use `path` instead of `file`
  - `app.py`: Updated property mapping to use `path`
  - `tests/test_git_operations.py`: Updated test expectations

#### 2. Empty Commit Parameter Handling
- **Problem**: Frontend sending empty strings `""` for commit parameters was triggering commit comparison logic instead of working directory logic
- **Solution**: Updated condition to handle empty strings properly:
```python
# Before:
if base_commit or target_commit:

# After: 
if (base_commit and base_commit.strip()) or (target_commit and target_commit.strip()):
```

#### 3. Untracked File Processing Logic
- **Problem**: Untracked files were being processed through diff parser when they shouldn't be
- **Solution**: Added condition to skip diff parsing for untracked files:
```python
if diff.get('content') and diff.get('status') != 'untracked':
    # Parse diff content
else:
    # Add as-is for untracked files
```

#### 4. Critical Frontend Filter Fix
- **Problem**: `showOnlyChanged` filter excluded untracked files
- **Solution**: Updated filter condition to include untracked files:
```javascript
// Before:
file.additions > 0 || file.deletions > 0

// After:
file.additions > 0 || file.deletions > 0 || file.status === 'untracked'
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
1. **Git Operations** (`git_operations.py`):
   - Standardized untracked file data structure to use `path` property
   - Fixed empty commit parameter handling logic
   - Ensured proper working directory vs commit comparison branching

2. **Application Layer** (`app.py`):
   - Updated diff processing to handle untracked files correctly
   - Prevented diff parsing for untracked files
   - Maintained consistent property naming

### Frontend Changes
1. **JavaScript Logic** (`app.js`):
   - Fixed critical filtering bug in `filterFiles()` function
   - Added proper handling for untracked files in change detection
   - Maintained all existing functionality (search, navigation, expand/collapse)

2. **Template Rendering** (`index.html`):
   - No changes required - template was correctly structured
   - Issue was purely in the data pipeline

### Testing
- All 52 tests pass with 82% coverage
- Manual verification confirmed untracked files now display correctly
- Verified backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Results

### Before Fix
- Untracked checkbox could be checked
- Untracked section would appear
- But no file names or content would show
- Files were being filtered out by `showOnlyChanged` logic

### After Fix
- ✅ Untracked files appear correctly in UI when checkbox is checked
- ✅ File names display properly  
- ✅ Files can be expanded/collapsed like other file types
- ✅ Consistent behavior with staged/unstaged files
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Search and filtering work correctly with untracked files

## Key Insights

1. **Data Pipeline Debugging**: The issue required tracing through the entire data pipeline from API → JavaScript → Template to identify the exact break point

2. **Filter Logic Complexity**: The "show only changed files" concept needed to include untracked files, which are technically "new" rather than "changed"

3. **Property Naming Consistency**: Inconsistent property naming between frontend and backend can cause subtle display issues

4. **Frontend State Management**: Alpine.js reactivity worked correctly; the issue was in the data processing layer, not the reactive framework

## Files Modified
- `src/difflicious/git_operations.py` - Data structure and logic fixes
- `src/difflicious/app.py` - Processing and property mapping
- `src/difflicious/static/js/app.js` - Critical filter fix
- `tests/test_git_operations.py` - Updated test expectations

## Lessons Learned
- Always trace data flow completely when debugging UI display issues
- Frontend filters need to account for all valid file states, not just traditional "changes"
- Consistent property naming across the stack prevents subtle bugs
- Browser console debugging is invaluable for frontend data flow issues

This session successfully resolved a critical user experience issue and completed the untracked files feature implementation.
