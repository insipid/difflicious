# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Difflicious is a lightweight web-based git diff visualization tool built with Flask backend and Alpine.js frontend. It provides developers with an elegant interface for viewing git changes while working on branches locally.

## Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend: Python Flask with secure subprocess calls for git operations
- Frontend: Alpine.js (~15KB) + vanilla CSS with Grid/Flexbox
- Real-time: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live git status monitoring
- Security: Proper subprocess sanitization for git command execution

**Distribution Strategy:**
1. PyPI package (primary) - `pip install difflicious`
2. Docker image (secondary) - containerized deployment  
3. Source installation (development fallback)

## Development Commands

This project uses `uv` for fast Python package management and development environments.

**Project Setup:**
```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv sync

# Run in development mode
uv run difflicious

# Access at localhost:5000
```

**Development Commands:**
```bash
# Add new dependencies
uv add package-name

# Add development dependencies
uv add --dev pytest ruff black

# Run tests (comprehensive test suite available)
uv run pytest

# Run linting/formatting
uv run ruff check
uv run black .

# Build package
uv build
```

**Docker Development:**
- Multi-stage builds using uv for optimized container images
- Base images will use uv for dependency installation

## Current Development Status

**Phase 1 - Project Setup & Core Backend (COMPLETED):**
1. âœ… Set up modern Python project structure with pyproject.toml and uv
2. âœ… Create Flask backend with proper uv-based packaging
3. âœ… Implement git command execution wrapper with security
4. âœ… Create basic HTML template with Alpine.js integration
5. âœ… Build JSON API endpoints for git status and diff data
6. ðŸš§ Create Dockerfile using uv for containerized deployment

**Implementation Completed:**
- âœ… Git command wrapper: Secure subprocess sanitization with comprehensive security validation
- âœ… Flask backend: Complete API with `/api/status` and `/api/diff` endpoints
- âœ… Frontend: Alpine.js reactive interface with search, filtering, and diff visualization
- âœ… Security: All git commands properly sanitized, injection prevention, path validation
- âœ… Testing: 28 tests with 73% coverage including security and functionality tests

## Core Features Status

- âœ… **Advanced Diff Parsing**: Complete git diff parser with side-by-side structure generation
- âœ… **Side-by-Side Visualization**: Professional-grade diff interface with line numbering and color coding
- âœ… **Interactive Controls**: Toggle visibility, search/filter capabilities implemented
- âœ… **Git Integration**: Live git status and structured diff data from real repositories
- âœ… **Command-line Interface**: Full CLI with host, port, debug options
- âœ… **Modern UI**: Tailwind CSS styling with responsive design
- ðŸš§ **Enhanced Syntax Highlighting**: Future improvement for code content highlighting
- ðŸš§ **Real-time Updates**: Server-Sent Events implementation planned

## Security Requirements (IMPLEMENTED)

- âœ… All git command execution uses proper subprocess sanitization
- âœ… Command injection prevention with argument validation and character filtering
- âœ… Safe git option validation with whitelist-based approach
- âœ… File path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
- âœ… Timeout protection for git commands to prevent resource exhaustion
- âœ… No exposure of sensitive git repository information
- âœ… Local-only operation (no external network calls for core functionality)

## Code Quality Requirements

- **File Formatting**: ALL TEXT FILES SHOULD END WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN
- **Documentation Sync**: Any changes to architecture/infrastructure must update PLAN.md, README.md, and CLAUDE.md to keep them in sync
- **Package Management**: Use `uv` for all Python dependency management and virtual environments
- **Security**: All git command execution must use proper subprocess sanitization

## Deployment Targets

The application is designed for multiple distribution channels:
- PyPI package for easy `pip install` (built with uv)
- Docker containers using uv for consistent, fast dependency installation
- Source installation with uv for development and customization
