# Difflicious

A sleek web-based git diff visualization tool used when working locally on branches. Difflicious provides a lightweight local web application that transforms git diffs into an intuitive, interactive experience.

## What is Difflicious?

Difflicious is a developer-focused tool that runs locally and provides a beautiful interface for viewing git changes. Instead of squinting at terminal output, you get a clean, searchable, and toggleable view of your work-in-progress changes.

Perfect for:
- Reviewing changes before committing
- Understanding complex diffs across multiple files
- Quickly navigating through modifications in your current branch
- Getting a bird's-eye view of your development progress

## Features

- **Elegant Diff Visualization**: Clean, syntax-highlighted display of file changes
- **Interactive Interface**: Toggle visibility, search through changes, and filter content
- **Secure Git Integration**: Safe git command execution with subprocess sanitization
- **Real-time Status**: Live git repository status and branch information
- **Lightweight**: Minimal infrastructure using Flask backend and Alpine.js frontend
- **Developer-Friendly**: Designed by developers, for developers

## Installation & Quick Start

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install via pip
pip install difflicious
