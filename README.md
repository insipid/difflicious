# Difflicious

A sleek web-based git diff visualization tool used when working locally on branches. Difflicious provides a lightweight local web application that transforms git diffs into an intuitive, interactive experience.

## What is Difflicious?

Difflicious is a developer-focused tool that runs locally and provides a beautiful interface for viewing git changes. Instead of squinting at terminal output, you get a clean, searchable, and toggleable view of your work-in-progress changes.

Perfect for:
- Reviewing changes before committing
- Understanding complex diffs across multiple files
- Quickly navigating through modifications in your current branch
- Getting a bird's-eye view of your development progress

## Features

- **Side-by-Side Diff Visualization**: Professional-grade side-by-side view with accurate line numbering
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Beautiful code highlighting for 30+ programming languages using Highlight.js
- **Intelligent Diff Parsing**: Advanced git diff parser with proper alignment of additions and deletions
- **Smart UI Controls**: Expand/collapse all buttons with intelligent disabled states
- **Interactive Interface**: Toggle visibility, search through changes, and filter content
- **Clean File Paths**: Automatic removal of git diff artifacts (a/, b/ prefixes)
- **Secure Git Integration**: Safe git command execution with subprocess sanitization
- **Real-time Status**: Live git repository status and branch information
- **Modern UI**: Clean Tailwind CSS design with responsive layout
- **Lightweight**: Minimal infrastructure using Flask backend and Alpine.js frontend
- **Developer-Friendly**: Designed by developers, for developers
